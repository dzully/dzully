### Future Is Gold 💛

With my refined skill set, I bring customer-centric mindfulness that enables firms to innovate and thrive. This is what I've done with ISN Malaysia, MYINSKEN and TNB as I provided technical expertise on industrial products to visionaries like Airbnb, Facebook and Google Maps 🌎.

My Intellectual curiosity also drives me to be a lifelong learner. I recently earned my MBA from UKM, with a graduate certificate in computer science 🧑‍🎓.
